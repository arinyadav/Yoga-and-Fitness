<h1>Bhujangasana</h1>
<p>Bhujangasana or Cobra Pose is a reclining back-bending asana in hatha yoga and modern yoga as exercise. It is commonly performed in a cycle of asanas in Surya Namaskar (Salute to the Sun) as an alternative to Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upwards Dog Pose).</p>

<h2>Types of Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose)</h2>
<p>Once you get comfortable with the cobra pose, you can start to attempt the different types of Bhujangasana available for more experienced yoga practitioners. Here is a closer look at the common types and variations of the cobra pose.</p>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Saral Hasta Bhujangasana</h3> </li>
</ul>
<p>Saral Hasta Bhujangasana literally translates to ‘extended hands cobra pose’. Here, the asana is performed with the upper body extended upward till there is no bend at the elbows. This variation puts more pressure on the lower back since a greater portion of your torso is lifted off the ground.</p>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Vakra Hasta Bhujangasana</h3> </li>
</ul>
<p>Vakra Hasta Bhujangasana means ‘curved hands cobra pose’. As the name indicates, this variation of the cobra pose is performed with a slight bend in your elbows. So, your upper body is closer to the ground and not fully extended upward.</p>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Ardha Bhujangasana</h3> </li>
</ul>
<p>The name Ardha Bhujangasana literally translates to ‘half cobra pose’. It is also known as the sphinx pose because the body resembles the sphinx in this pose. Here, you rest your forearms entirely on the ground, from elbows to palms.</p>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Niralamba Bhujangasana</h3> </li>
</ul>
<p>This is an unsupported version of the cobra pose. Here, you need to lift your hands off the ground and clasp both your palms together behind your back. The only point of contact between your body and the ground is from your feet to your hips. Your hands will not be in contact with the ground.</p>
